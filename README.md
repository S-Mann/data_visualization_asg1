This is a very basic sample using chart js and dataframe js to visualize details on the huge upset in 2015-2016 NBA finals


I have used chart js and dataframe js with a nice bootstrap front end borrowed from bootstrap boiler plate for collapse-sidebar. All you need is a *mozilla firefox browser* and *internet* to run this with all the csv and other files downloaded in one directory.
