        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div id="intro">
          <p>
            In the season of 2015-2016 two of the greatest records were broken.
            Golden State Warriors <b>GSW</b> set a regular season record of
            <b><i>73-9</i></b> which means they
            <u>just lost 9 times in the whole season.</u> Which is by far the
            most impressive accomplishment in NBA. With a record so good
            everyone had <b>GSW</b> as the NBA champion even before the playoffs
            started. What happened next was one of the rarest event in
            professional sports in all of North America. The Cleveland Cavaliers
            <b>CLE</b> were down in the NBA finals <b><i>3-1</i></b> to
            <b>GSW</b>,
            <u><b>GSW</b> just had to win one match to close the series</u> and
            become champions. But <b>GSW</b> went down with the biggest upset in
            professional sports,
            <u
              ><b>GSW</b> lost 3 straight games making <b>CLE</b> the
              champions.</u
            >
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Top Tier</h2>
        <div class="row" id="quest1">
          <div class="col-sm-3">
            <p>
              After the completion of the regular season, the top 4 teams with
              the highest chances of winning the championship was Cleveland
              Cavaliers <b>CLE</b>, Toronto Raptors <b>TOR</b>, Golden State
              Warriors <b>GSW</b> and San Antonio Spurs <b>SAS</b>. As usual the
              West is usually the stronger conference amongst East and West. We
              have
              <u
                ><b>GSW</b> and <b>SAS</b> which had the highest chances of
                winning the championship and were from the West</u
              >. Both the
              <u
                >teams from the East had a very low chance of winning the
                championship.</u

              When all was said and done the finals was between the
              <b>GSW</b> and <b>CLE</b>. In this bar graph
              <u
                >we can see how the teams compared to their opponents in the
                regular season.</u
              >
              The graph shows a clear point difference of <b>+10</b> on average
              for <b>GSW</b> and <b>+6</b> for <b>CLE</b>. Maintianing a
              <b>+10</b> point difference in the west is really an achievement.

        <h2>The Best Under Pressure</h2>

              When
              <u

                finals to their regular season</u
              >, we see that
              <u
                ><b>GSW</b> completely choked and went from 114 points on
                average to 99 points per game,</u
              >
              <b>CLE</b> also had a drop off but it isn't as drastic as that of
              <b>GSW</b>.

              In this graph we can see that in reality <b>CLE</b> didn't play
              better than their regular season. In reality <b>GSW</b> really
              slowed down and their stats across the board dropped drastically.
              <u
                ><b>CLE</b> pretty much played their game at their pace and
                brought <b>GSW</b> to their level.</u

            <p>
              Being the underdogs <b>CLE</b> had all odds against them. While
              all the predictions said <b>GSW</b> would win the championship the
              result differed and <b>CLE</b> won at last. Maybe a reference to
              <u>The Chaos Theory.</u> To give you a better understanding when
              <u
                ><b>GSW</b> was up <b>3-1</b> in the series the chances of them
                winning was <b>94.1%</b> if you would have bet <b>10,000</b> on
                <b>CLE</b> winning the series<b>(before game 5)</b>, you would
                have made <b>120,000.</b></u
              >
              No team in the professional sport has ever comeback from down
              <b>3-1</b>, only <b>CLE</b> has done it, in many ways thanks to
              <u><b>LeBron James.</b></u>
